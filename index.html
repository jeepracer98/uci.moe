    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the Anime Club of UC Irvine!
    </p>
    <p>
        We are a student-run club orientated around an interest in Anime and its related mediums. We have members with similar interests in manga, manhwa, visual novels, games, and convention-going. We are also trying to build a larger community of artists, cosplayers, and even voice actors!
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether you might be a lurking introvert or an active attendee — a member, alumni, or visitor — we welcome all that are friendly with open arms!
    </p>
    <p>
        We are also known as <b>Cal Animage Epsilon (CAE)</b>, which remains as a formal and synonymous club name. Under this title, we are proud to be UCI’s anime club and a member of the <a href="https://animage.moe/">Cal Animage Network</a> since 1990.

    <h1>Meetings + Screening Squad</h1>
    <p>
        All friendly members, alumni, and visitors are welcome to our meetings!
    </p>
    <p>
        Our club has two different meetings per week. <b>General Meetings</b> serve as our main weekly meetings for activities, workshops, short screenings, etc. We also have <b>Screening Squad</b> Meetings, which are typically more relaxed, simple, and hands-off: watch anime with others!
    </p>
    <p>
        Screening Meetings are held by the <b>Anime Club Screening Squad</b> (or <b>CAE Screening Squad</b>), a subdivision of the Club. <a href="https://uci.moe/ss_discord/">Join the Screening Squad Discord here</a>.

    Welcome to the Anime Community Club @ UCI!</br></br>

    We are a student club at UCI that orientates itself around a similar interest in Anime and its related mediums. We believe that there’s more to anime than just watching it when we interact and assemble. As such, we strive to host events, activities, and other functions for our fellow friends and Anteaters to intermingle!</br></br>

    We have members with similar interests in manga, manhwa, visual novels, games, and conventioning. We are also trying to build a larger community of artists, cosplayers, and even voice actors!</br></br>

    Whether you might be a lurking introvert or an active attendee, we welcome all friendly Anteaters and guests with open arms!</br></br>

    <b>All club affairs – including meetings, membership, and activities – are communicated mainly through our Discord Server and our mailing list. Please join us if you’re interested!</b>
                        </p>

    <b>Cal Animage Epsilon (CAE)</b>, founded in October 1990, was the first anime club at UCI and was founded as part of the Cal Animage system. CAE eventually made <b>CAE Masquerade</b> as a subdivision club that would focus on performances, namely for the “Masquerade” events present at conventions such as Animé Los Angeles.</br></br>

    Things changed as CAE Masquerade would eventually rebrand itself as the <b>Anime Community Club @ UCI</b> in 201x to reflect a change in purpose. The Anime Club @ UCI still stands today as a sister-club of CAE.

    <b>ZotCon</b></br>
    ZotCon is the anime-themed convention club at UCI. They’re responsible for holding annual anime-themed conventions at our campus. We strongly support their efforts!</br></br>

    <b>Cal Animage Epsilon</b></br>
    Cal Animage Epsilon (CAE) is our anime sister-club at UCI. While we emphasize more on watching anime, CAE focuses more on anime screenings. Many members are members of both clubs!</br></br>

    Anteaters who play osu! What more can you ask for?

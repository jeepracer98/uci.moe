                <p>
                    Welcome to the Anime Club at UCI!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are a student-run club at UC Irvine orientated around a common interest in Anime and its related mediums. Our members engage in an array of hobbies such as art-making, cosplay, convention-going. Our members often share interests in manga, games, music, and so much more. If you have an anime-related interest or endeavor, consider us an ally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal as a club is to be a home to those that can share a friendly and comfortable enjoyment of anime – and each other. Whether you may be shy or sociable, we invite you to join us!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are also known as <b>Cal Animage Epsilon (CAE)</b>, which remains as a formal and synonymous club name. Under this title, we are proud to be UCI’s anime club and a member of the <a href="https://animage.moe/">Cal Animage Network</a> since 1990.

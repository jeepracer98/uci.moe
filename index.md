Notes:
    * color for navbar is under .navbar-inverse in one-page-wonder-jekyll/assets/app.css
    * to edit or add to the section names in the navbar, they're under where it says "div id='menu'" in _layouts/default.html
    * For editing social links and club image, check under "div class='headline'".
    * To edit the title, change it in _config.yml, the title variable in this file isn't used unless that one is missing.
    * The icons are 512x512 ripped from fontawesome (I put a thing in the footer to make sure we're good on copyright) Then I put it in Photoshop and did a 8px stroke and shrunk most of them to 94% so that the stroke just fit within the image

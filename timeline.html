        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            Cal Animage Epsilon (CAE) was founded in October 1990 as a member of the Cal Animage Network. As the first anime club at UC Irvine, it evolved to become the club that we are today.
        </p>
        <p>
            This timeline was made to display the long history of our club. We derive much of our information and materials from a limited array of old records and first-hand accounts. There is always more history to uncover, so compiling this timeline is an ongoing process. If you are an alumni or an old affiliate who might be interested in sharing a story with us, we encourage you to reach out!

            Before returning to in-person meetings, both anime clubs reunited as simply the Anime Club @ UCI (Cal Animage Epsilon). Fall 2021 saw a return to in-person meetings after more than a year of online instruction; ENIGMA was resurrected for Halloween. The first half of Winter 2022 temporarily returned to virtual meetings as a result of COVID. Spring 2022 saw the return of ZotCon and an improvement of membership diversity.

        <p>
            As the COVID-19 pandemic continued, university instruction and club meetings were entirely virtual for 2020-2021. In substitution of in-person meetings, both Cal Animage Epsilon and the Anime Community Club continued holding meetings on their respective Discord servers. As vaccines began becoming more widely distributed by the summer, a number of ACC members met up in-person for the first time; outings included seeing the Demon Slayer Mugen Train movie and a re-traditional trip to Little Tokyo.

            In the summer of 2019, CAE’s sister-club rebranded itself from “CAE Masquerade” to the “Anime Community Club at UCI”. The rebranding was done to reflect a shift in focus from Masquerade performances to a more broad emphasis on community interactions. Both clubs shared many of the same members, but held separate meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Spring quarter of 2019 saw both clubs transfer to virtual meetings as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; meetings were held on respective club-dedicated Discord servers.

            <center><b>Jerry Chu’s insight</b></center><br />
            For well into the 2000's -- Officers would maintain a large library of VHS fansubtitled anime in these huge bins and allowed for members to check out on a weekly basis. Every club meeting, there would be a mad rush to return tapes in the beginning of the meeting and line up to check out tapes towards the end. Officers would maintain the completeness, addition, and management of the library often lugging the bins from off campus to the club meeting locations each week.<br />
            Having a long history as related org with Cal Animage (UC system and beyond) - much of the communication and co-mingling between different schools occured as volunteers for Anime Expo each year. Most of the officers and some members from CAE were assigned as AX staff managing the "Hospitality" department. This group was responsible for feeding the entire volunteer corp running Anime Expo smoothly and efficiently each year.<br />
            <br />
            Between 1992-1999 UCI's bookstore managed an extension store called Alt.Ant which was a fantastic source for the latest and greatest anime soundtracks, laserdiscs, artbooks, and merchandise at the time. The store was one of the few places in the US actively selling newly imported merchandise from Japan at the time and we were lucky to have it in on campus. Mike Kiley was the manager of the bookstore and later went on to help establish Tokyo Pop manga.<br />

            <center><b>Kong Chang’s insight</b></center><br />
            What's funny was that we were officially called "Anime Appreciation Club" in Spring of 1991, founded by David Cotelessa and Larry Mann. This was before we became a chapter of "Cal Animage" one official quarter after Spring (not counting summer) in Fall, 1991. Cal-Animage started in UC Berkeley and had 10 chapters. We were the Epsilon chapter (chapter number 5). CAE was formed after I advised David that we should join in the Cal Animage group, as they were dominant body in the anime fandom and on IRC channel #anime back in those days. Plus, their founder, Mike Tatsugawa, headed and speared the project of creating a convention around Anime, the first convention being held in San Jose, CA, called "Anime Con '91" (which later became Anime Expo due to some political nonsense and some people splitting from the SPJA to form Anime America, which only lasted a few years before they died out, which then later some of those stragglers with some help from Anime Expo staff formed FanimeCon back in the mid-90's).<br />
            …<br />
             It's true that you can watch anime by yourself alone in your own room, but it's more exciting to hear other people's reactions in the room or to hear their thoughts and feelings about certain story plots and such. That's the core of our anime club.<br />

# uci.moe

These are the files hosted on uci.moe.  Unfortunately they are a bit of a mess.


## Usual Things to Edit
### The meeting times:
* Edit the times in `_includes/main_header.html`
### The main page content:
* The content itself is in `index.html`
* Don't forget to edit the header in `_includes/main_menu.html` so that the anchor
  buttons at the top work.
### The timeline:
* Just copy it from one of the other year sections and edit.
* You'll probably need to edit the URL that Google Sheets gives you to set the custom
  switching time and stuff (which is `?start=true&loop=true&delayms=15000` as of now).

    <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
    <p>
        AniUCI Research Group (A.R.G.) is a subgroup of Anime Club @ UCI which aims to foster an environment of academic study into anime. This will allow those who are passionate about researching and analyzing anime to practice writing about it with critical feedback and exposure. A.R.G. will also accept all forms of analytical engagement with anime or related subjects. Our goal is to allow students to present their ideas in a variety of academic engagements. Whether it be submitting a paper for unofficial peer review or seeking help finding a journal to publish in, we aim to provide support to those who wish to study anime at any level.
